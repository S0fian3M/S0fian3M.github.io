Why do some countries with low levels of trust in public institutions reached high rates of compliance to stay-at-home orders during the Covid-19 pandemic? I used data from Google Community Mobility Reports and social surveys to develop counterfactual reasoning through data-driven agent-based simulations that explore compliance mechanisms. The results highlight the importance of government measures in achieving high compliance rates and demonstrate systematic improvements in model performance when social interaction mechanisms are incorporated.
