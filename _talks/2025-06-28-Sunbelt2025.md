Covid-19 pandemic is a striking example of remarkable public compliance with stay-at-home orders, although the restrictions imposed susbstantial economic and health costs on individuals. In order to assess the explanatory power of several mechanisms of compliance and test the effects of network characteristics, I developped an empirically-driven agent-based model able to replicate trends of compliance, while being parcimonious in its assumptions. I demonstrate how trust in public and political institutions creates the conditions for interpersonal relations to produce a behavioural contagion.
