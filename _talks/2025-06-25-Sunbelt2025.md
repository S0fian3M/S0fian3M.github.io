While a majority of individuals are aware of and concerned about climate change, only a minority have consequently changed their behaviours towards more sustainable lifestyles. Nevertheless, extant explanations of this attitude-behaviour gap have limited explanatory power. I demonstrate that social capital and social network variables can account for a proportion of the variance. Therefore, I argue that novel methodologies are required for the collection of empirical data and the study of mechanisms of green consumption. Finally, I illustrate the manner in which the utilisation of a mobile application facilitates both the data collection process and the implementation of social experiments.
