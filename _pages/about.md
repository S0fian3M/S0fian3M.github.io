What am I studying?
======
I'm researching what makes people adopt (or not) more sustainable lifestyles, and how eco-friendly habits spread from person to person. Methodologically, I'm mostly interested in quantitative, experimental and computational sociology. The temporary title of my PhD dissertation is: <a href="https://theses.fr/s396191" target="_blank">Dynamics of change in green consumption perception and behaviours in France. An agent-based model study with generative agents</a>.

<i>While a majority of individuals are aware of and concerned about climate change, only a minority have onsequently changed their behaviours towards more sustainable lifestyles. Nevertheless, extant explanations of this attitude-behaviour gap have limited explanatory power. Using survey analysis, experimentations, network analysis and agent-based models, I aim to explore the potential of social networks to explain the attitude-behaviour gap with regard to sustainable consumption.</i>
