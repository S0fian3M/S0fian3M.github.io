What am I studying?
======
In my PhD thesis, I'm studying green consumption and sufficiency behaviors using mixed methods (quantitatives and qualitatives methods) and agent-based models. Its temporary title is: <a href="https://theses.fr/s396191" target="_blank">Dynamics of change in green consumption perception and behaviors in France. An agent-based model study with generative agents</a>.
