## Some other projects I'm proud of

### <a href="https://the-french-connections.github.io/" target="_blank">The French Connections</a>

"The French Connections" is a game I developped and update every week. It is an adaptation (in french) of the New York Times "Connections" game, which itself is highly inspired by the British TV game "Only Connect". You can play it at: <a href="https://the-french-connections.github.io/" target="_blank">https://the-french-connections.github.io/</a>.

### Master's thesis

You can find my Master's thesis (in french), here: <a href="../files/MAZIERES_Sofiane_Mémoire_RESSP_M2.pdf" target="_blank">« Study of the determinants of conformation during the Covid-19 pandemic in France. Analysis agent-based models. »</a>
